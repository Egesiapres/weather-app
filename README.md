# Weather app

### Description
A personal project to improve my vanilla JS skills

### 1. Scope
I wanted to create a good looking weather app able to show the weather of the chosen city: it can be manually searched or automatically retrieved thanks to geolocation.

Interacting with the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) APIs, the app shows:
* current weather
* temperature
* 5 days forecast
* wind info
* sun info
* humidity, air, pressure, and visibility info

The app can also perform temperature conversions, allowing to choose between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales.

### 2. Tools
HTML, CSS, JS
